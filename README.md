This repository contains the files needed to run the experiments and evaluate the results for LLMs and NMT implementations.
Unfortunately, the original corpus sections could not be procured for this repo as access to them has been lost.

These files were used in research done to create the paper:
William Jock Boyd and Ruslan Mitkov. 2025."Machine Translation in the AI Era: Comparing previous methods of machine translation with large language models". Proceedings of the 8th Workshop on Challenges and Applications of Automated Extraction of Socio-political Events from Text. Varna, Bulgaria.
